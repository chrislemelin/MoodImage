MoodImage
======
MoodImage is a small application that uses the Microsoft Emotion API.

The API takes images and does an analysis on the emotions on the people in the picture. I wanted to make some kind of Skype add on that would provide a live feed of the emotions what the other person is feeling. 
It would really be helpful for autistic people as they have a hard time figuring out what emotions people are feeling. However, there really isn't an easy way to get access to what Skype is streaming so I decided to make a seperate application that will take a screenshot of your screen and analyze it.
